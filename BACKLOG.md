# CampusConnect Backlog

PBIs, not tasks. Each is sized to be handed to Claude Code as a self-contained
prompt. One committed fix/feature per concern (see `CLAUDE.md` §3.2).
Effort scale: `3` = half a day to a day, `5` = one to two days, `8` = three-plus
days. Anything smaller goes straight into a commit.

Goal: a consumer-usable app for the FYP demo/defense (~Oct/Nov 2026). Finished
epics are summarized below; their detail lives in `git log`.

---

## Completed epics

- **A — Code health & CI gate.** Typecheck+build gate, lint clean on both apps,
  error-handling and `any` sweep.
- **B — Long-term memory chat (RAG).** Named threads, persisted history, auto
  titles, query contextualization, vector-backed cross-session memory, token budget.
- **C — AI chat UX polish.** Copy/like/dislike toolbar, composer, resource-card
  citations, code-block copy.
- **D — Design system & UI overhaul (D1–D10).** "Warm neutral" tokens, Lucide
  icons, 5-item app shell, and redesigns of Home, Library, Ask AI, Messages,
  Mentors, Profile, Community, landing, auth and onboarding.
- **E — Contributors, mentorship & messenger (E1–E16).** Messenger, reputation
  ledger and tiers, contributor applications, mentor directory/requests/ratings/
  endorsements/recommendations, contextual chat, AI attribution + "ask a human",
  impact panel + leaderboard, block/report/admin moderation.
- **G — Quick fixes & resilience (G1–G5).** Debug logs and dead theme removed,
  UI sweep, server boots with Qdrant down, password change requires current password.
- **F — Google OAuth sign-in (F1–F3).** Any Google account can sign in; a verified email links to
  an existing local account; one-time-code redirect, so no tokens in URLs. Verified end to end 2026-10-03.
- **H1 — Demo database + seed script** (`npm run seed:demo`, `campusconnect_demo`).

### Open follow-ups carried over (not scheduled)
- Google sign-in shortcuts: exchange codes are in memory (single instance only; use Redis to
  scale), no OAuth `state` parameter, case-sensitive email lookup. On the host, set
  `CLIENT_ID`, `CLIENT_SECRET`, `GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL`, `FRONTEND_URL`, and register the
  deployed callback URL in Google Cloud.
- Audit every `@Prop({ type: Types.ObjectId })` (Mixed path, no casting):
  `Post.author`, `Message.sender`, etc. Fix with `SchemaTypes.ObjectId` + migration.
- Rating counters (E11) aren't transactional with the rating write; no recompute job.
- "Ask a human" (E14) doesn't exclude blocked / already-mentoring mentors.
- Reports: no rate limit, no reporter notification, no reporting from community posts.
- Seed data: re-run the seed close to the demo date so "This month" leaderboard isn't empty.
- `CLAUDE.md` §5 still says 9/10 server suites fail (A12); all 52 now pass. Review the
  advisory `test` CI job and make it required.

## Epic D (continued) — D11 comes before H2/H3

### D11 — Coherent two-pane layout for Ask AI and Messages
**Effort:** 5
**Where:** `shared/components/layout/*`, `features/ai-chat/*`, `features/chat/*`
**Why:** Both screens put a thread/conversation list directly beside the app's
own sidebar: two left columns, with different widths, headers and styles.
**Decision (2026-10-03):** the list stays always visible on desktop (no
drawer); the app rail collapses to icons on these routes.
**Acceptance criteria:**
- On desktop, `/ai` and `/chat` show the app rail collapsed (icons only)
  regardless of the saved preference; other routes are unchanged.
- One shared list-pane (same width, header with title + "new" action, search,
  row style, active highlight) used by both screens.
- Mobile unchanged: one pane at a time.

## Epic H — Demo readiness (H2, H3 open)

### H2 — Empty, loading and error states pass
**Status: code DONE 2026-10-03, manual verification pending.** New shared
`InlineError` (message + Retry) and a flat `EmptyState` (title, message, next
action). Applied to Home widgets, Messages and Ask AI (lists, history, feed),
Community rail and comments, admin panels, both profile pages and tabs,
Mentorship lists, Settings and notifications. Fixed along the way: a failed
request used to render the *empty* state (Home widgets "Nothing has been
shared", Ask AI thread history showing the new-chat prompts) and Settings
showed a skeleton forever. Library, Leaderboard, Mentor directory and Resource
detail already had retries. **Still to do:** run the app as an empty user on the
demo DB and with the API stopped, and fix what that shows.
**Effort:** 5
**Where:** every page redesigned in D6–D10
**Why:** A usable app is mostly defined by the unhappy paths: first-run
empty states that tell you what to do, skeletons instead of spinners/blank,
and errors that say what happened and offer a retry.
**Acceptance criteria:**
- Every list/page has a designed empty state with a next action.
- Skeleton loaders matching final layout for all primary lists.
- Network/API errors show an inline retry, not a blank page or only a toast.
- Verified by running the app against an empty user in the demo DB and
  with the API stopped.

### H3 — Demo walkthrough + final visual QA
**Effort:** 3
**Where:** docs outside the repo (FYP docs) + fixes found
**Why:** The defense is a scripted story; the product should be tuned to it.
**Acceptance criteria:**
- Written walkthrough: sign in → home → find resource → ask AI → citation
  shows contributor → ask a human → mentorship → messenger → admin moderation.
- Every screen in the walkthrough screenshotted in both modes at desktop
  and 390px mobile; issues fixed or logged.
